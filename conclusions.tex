\chapter{Conclusions and future work}


\section{Conclusions}

\begin{itemize}

\item Data generated by huge scientific projects are becoming a problem.

\item Relational approach are not always suitable for any problem. Non-relational systems are not cure-all, but it has been shown they can face some problems in a more efficient way (\textit{e.g.} MapReduce).

\item Any new proposal should be inside Virtual Observatory frame.

\item NoSQL database systems, specially -not exclusively- those document-oriented can reduce system analysis and design and can also succeed in boosting the performance of data management.

\end{itemize}

\section{Future work}

\begin{itemize}

\item It would be desirable to focus in a work group inside Virtual Observatory instead of treating several aspects.

\item It is highly recommended to use formal metrics to measure the effectiveness of systems rewriting/redesigning.

\item In order to obtain accurate data in performance improvements benchmarks must be used.

\item It would be of interest to decide which language to use to connect the selected DBMS.

\end{itemize}
