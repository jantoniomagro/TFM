\label{sec:conclusions}

\begin{itemize}

\item Relational approach are not always suitable for any problem. Non-relational systems are not cure-all, but it has been shown they can face some problems in a more efficient way (\textit{e.g.} MapReduce) and, in some situations, NoSQL can be a complement for existing RDBMS.

\item Any new proposal should be inside Virtual Observatory frame.

\item NoSQL database systems, specially -not exclusively- those document-oriented can reduce system analysis and design and can also succeed in boosting the performance of data management.

\end{itemize}

\section{Future work} % (fold)
\label{sec:future_work}

\begin{itemize}

\item Focusing in a workgroup inside Virtual Observatory instead of treating several aspects.

\item The use of formal metrics (CoCoMo, Function Point Analysis, etc.) to plan the software design and development and the costs involved.

\item Benchmarks support in order to obtain accurate data in performance improvements.

\item Deciding which language to use to connect the selected DBMS.

\end{itemize}
