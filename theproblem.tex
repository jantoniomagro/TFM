\chapter{Astronomy Big Data}\label{theproblem}


Big data are high-volume, high-velocity, and/or high-variety information assets that require new forms of processing to enable enhanced decision making, insight discovery and process optimization. Examples of big data include information such as Web search results, electronic messages (e.g. SMS, email and instant messages), social media postings, pictures, videos and even system log data. However, it can also include cash transactions, check images, receipts and other transactional information depending on the source of the information. This situation requires processing of terabytes and even petabytes of data. This is achieved by distributed processing. This is one of major reasons for the power of Web companies such as
Google, Amazon or social networks like Facebook and Twitter. Relational databases are found to be inadequate in distributed processing involving very large number of servers and handling Big Data applications. \newline

Astronomical datasets are growing at an exponential rate: the next generation of telescopes will collect data at rates in terabytes per day. This data deluge, now and int the future, presents some critical challenges for the way astronomers get new knowledge from their data. \newline

In this chapter, we make an overview of some of the greatest telescopes and the amount of data they acquire and store.


\section{Atacama Large Millimiter Array}

ALMA is a worldwide project; the synthesis of early visions of astronomers in its three partner communities: Europe, North America and Japan. It is a fusion of ideas, with its roots in three astronomical projects: the Millimeter Array (MMA) of the United States, the Large Southern Array (LSA) of Europe, and the Large Millimeter Array (LMA) of Japan.\newline

ALMA is an instrument that consists of a giant array of 12-m antennas with baselines up to 16 km, and an additional compact array of 7-m and 12-m antennas to greatly enhance ALMA's ability to image extended targets, located on the Chajnantor plateau at 5000m altitude. Initially, it will observe at wavelengths in the range $3 mm$ to $400 μm$ ($84$ to $720 GHz$). The antennas can be moved around, in order to form arrays with different distributions of baseline lengths. More extended arrays will give high spatial resolution, more compact arrays give better sensitivity for extended sources. In addition to the array of 12-m antennas, there is the Atacama Compact Array (ACA), used to image large scale structures that are not well sampled by the ALMA 12-m array, consisting of twelve 7-m antennas and four 12-m antennas. \newline

The design of ALMA is driven by three key science goals:

\begin{itemize}

\item Detecting spectral line emission from CO in a normal galaxy like the Milky Way at a redshift of $z=3$, in less than 24 hours.

\item Imaging the gas kinematics in protostars and in protoplanetary disks around young Sun-like stars in the nearest molecular clouds ($150 pc$).

\item Providing precise high dynamic range images at an angular resolution of $0.1 arcsec$
\end{itemize}

The current ALMA Archive design allows for a maximum data rate of 64 MB/s and an average data rate
of 6.4 MB/s, which produces the long-term storage capacity of approximately 200 TB/year. The
ALMA correlators can producing a data up to 1000 MB/s. \newline

 
As stated in \cite{Etoka12}, the purpose of the ALMA archive is to provide services for:

\begin{itemize}
\item Persistent archiving and retrieval for observational data.
\item Observaction descriptors.
\item Datacubes produced by pipeline.
\item Technical and environmental data.
\end{itemize}

The main objective of the conceptual design of the ALMA Archive is to guarantee that three ALMA Regional Centres (North America, Japan and Europe) hold an identical copy of the archive at the Joint ALMA Observatory in Santiago. \newline

ALMA front-end archive is optimized for storage and preservation, not for data query and retrieval. ASA database is inspired from ObsCore, RADAMS and Hubble Legacy Archive plus Virtual Observatory Software:

\begin{itemize}
\item openCADC (\ref{opencadc}), which is used for database access and VO access protocol
\item VOView, for Web components
\end{itemize}



\section{Square Kilometer Array}

The Square Kilometer Array (SKA) is a global science and engineering project led by the SKA Organization, a not-for-profit company with its headquarters at Jodrell Bank Observatory, near Manchester. When construction starts in 2016 (according to official schedule) in Australia and in Southern Africa, thousands of linked radio wave receptors will be located to combine the signals from the antennas in each region creating a telescope with a collecting area equivalent to a dish with an area of about one square kilometer to discover how the first stars and galaxies formed after the Big Bang, how galaxies have evolved and the nature of gravity. It comprises:

\begin{itemize}
\item An array of dish receptors in eight African countries. 
\item An array of mid frequency aperture arrays in the Karoo. 
\item A smaller array of dish receptors and an array of low frequency aperture arrays in the Murchison Radio-astronomy Observatory in Australia.
\end{itemize}

Some relevant figures and facts about SKA:

\begin{itemize}

\item The data collected by the SKA in a single day would take nearly two million years to playback on an ipod.
\item The SKA central computer will have the processing power of about one hundred million PCs.
\item The SKA will use enough optical fibre to wrap twice around the Earth.
\item The dishes of the SKA will produce 10 times the global internet traffic.
\item The SKA will generate enough raw data to fill 15 million 64 GB iPods every day.
\item SKA will be able to detect an airport radar on a planet 50 light years away.

\end{itemize}




\section{Murchinson Widefield Array}


The Murchison Widefield Array is the first Square Kilometre Array precursor to enter full operations, generating a huge amount of information that needs to be stored for later retrieval by scientists. To store the data generated by the MWA three 1 TB hard drives every two hours are needed (it will store about 3 Petabytes at the Pawsey Center each year), so the isn not just a matter of storing the observations but how to distribute them from the MWA team in remote places, like MIT, Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand and India. \newline

According to Professor Andreas Wicenec, from The University of Western Australia node of the International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research (ICRAR), SKA has ``now have more than 400 megabytes per second of MWA data streaming along the National Broadband Networ¡k from the desert 800 km away''. Data travels through a 10 gigabit per second connection between the Murchison Radio-astronomy Observatory (MRO) and Geraldton. \footnote{\url{http://www.skatelescope.org/news/pawsey-centre/}}

The data are not obviously intended to be fully available for everybody at every time: for instance, MIT researchers are interested in the early universe so filtering techniques to control what data is copied from the Pawsey Center archive to the MIT machines are used. By 2013, more than 150 TB of data had been transferred automatically to the MIT store, with a stream of up to 4 TB a day increasing that value. \newline




\section{Large Synoptic Survey Telescope}

The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) is a new kind of telescope whose widefield of view allows it to observe large areas of the sky at once. It can take almost 1000 panoramic images each night, it can cover the sky twice a week. Data from LSST will be used to create a 3D map of the Universe with unprecedented depth and detail. Plans for sharing the data from LSST with the public are really ambitious, as it is intended that anyone with a PC can fly through the Universe, zooming past objects a hundred million times fainter than can be observed with the human eye. \newline

Some of the institutional members are Google, Caltech, Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory or STSI. \footnote{For a full list of institutional members, browse to \url{http://lsst.org/lsst/about/members}}  \newline


LSST observing will produce about 30 TB per night, leading to a total database over the ten years of operations of 60 PB for the raw data, and 30 PB for the catalog database, that will be processed using 100 TFlops. The data will be sent over existing optical fiber links from Chile to the U.S. \newline

Currently finishing the design and development stages, it is expected to start operating in 2022.
